- I have implemented class for Node
- I have used heapq for the priority queue to reduce the time complexity for push and pop operations
- time complexity is 
        - encodimg is O(nlog(n)) due to that we loop over all charecters then pop each 2 nodes then push one and so on
        - decode is O(n)

- space O(n)
