Udacity Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree Projects

To complete the this nanodegree I need to complete 4 coding projects, each one contains one or proplems

## Project 1
Unscramble Computer Science Problems
In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

## Project 2
Show Me the Data Structures
For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the data structures you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.

## Project 3
Problems vs. Algorithms
For this project, you will answer the seven questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.

## Project 4
Route Planner
In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
